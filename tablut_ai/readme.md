# Rules for Tablut

Rules for Tablut
The rules recorded in Latin by Carl Linnaeus give almost a complete game, lacking only a few particulars, such as who moves first. Below is presented a complete and playable scheme, followed by notes on what has been added, or in one instance changed, from Linnaeus' original Latin description.

1. Tablut is played on a board of 9Ã—9 squares.

2. There are 25 pieces: a king and his eight defenders, and sixteen attackers. These are placed in the shape of a cross with serifs, as in the diagram.

3. The attacking side takes the first move.

4. Pieces move any distance orthogonally, not landing on nor jumping over other pieces on the board.

5. No piece may land on the central square, called the "castle", not even the king once he has left it.

6. A piece other than the king is captured when it is surrounded orthogonally on two opposite squares by enemies. The king can pair up with a defender for the purpose of capturing attackers.

7. A piece may also be captured between an enemy and the empty castle.

8. When in the castle, the king is captured by surrounding him on four orthogonal sides with attackers.

9. When stood beside the castle, the king may be captured by surrounding him on the remaining three sides with attackers.

10. Elsewhere on the board, the king is captured as other pieces.

11. If the king when in the castle is surrounded on three sides by attackers, and on the fourth by a defender, the defender may be captured by surrounding it between an attacker and the king.

12. The king wins the game on reaching any square at the edge of the board. The attackers win if they capture the king.

13. The game is drawn if a position is repeated, if a player cannot move, or if the players otherwise agree it.
